Below is a concise, modern, step-by-step plan to prototype and execute True SCoTD with a budget under $50, using DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 32B as teacher and Gemma 3 4B as student, focused on GSM8K math reasoning. No code included.

Executive perspective (2025)

Applicability: SCoTD still holds. Small models (3–7B) gain markedly from visible CoT distillation, even with modest N if you filter and keep formatting tight.
Teacher choice: deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b is strong for math CoT and very low-cost per token. Good fit.
Student choice: gemma-3-4b is a capable, stable 4B foundation; LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning works on consumer GPUs.
Key updates vs 2023: you can succeed with small-N if you (1) curate concise CoTs, (2) enforce answer-checking filters, (3) keep CoT style consistent and short, and (4) optionally use light self-consistency at inference.
Budget model (fits <$50)

GSM8K train ~7.5k items.
Small-N plan: average N=5 per item (adaptive up to 8 on “hard” items).
Token cost estimate with $0.27/M in + $0.27/M out:
Prompt 900–1100 tokens ($0.00027/request), output cap 200–400 tokens (~$0.00007–$0.00009).
Per sample ≈ $0.00034. For 7,500 × N=5 = 37,500 samples → ≈ $12.8.
Headroom for prompts iteration + extra sampling: ~$5–10.
Fine-tuning (QLoRA on 4B) on a rented 24–48 GB GPU: ~$10–20 for a few hours.
Total projected cost: ~$30–40.
High-level goals

Primary task: GSM8K. Use visible chain-of-thought with strict, concise formatting.
Distillation: True SCoTD with sampled teacher CoTs (small-N), mostly label-correct filtering.
Baselines: zero-shot direct, zero-shot CoT, label-only fine-tune (QA), SCoTD (yours).
Output formatting: visible CoT for math; for simpler tasks (e.g., classification), use short “scratchpad” CoT.
Step-by-step plan

Phase 0 — Decisions and guardrails (1 day)

Dataset: GSM8K. Split: train→(train 6.7k / val 0.8k), test untouched.
Output schema (visible CoT):
Reasoning: two to six concise steps, arithmetic explicit.
Final Answer: integer/decimal in a canonical “Final Answer: 123” line.
Parsing: always place the final answer on its own line with a fixed prefix to enable exact match and auto-checking.
Ethics/visible-CoT: limit CoT exposure to research context; report automation-bias caveats in write-up.

Phase 1 — Prototyping the teacher prompt + sampling (2–3 days)

Build a 8–10-shot CoT prompt for GSM8K with very concise exemplars:
Each example contains: Question, short Reasoning (3–6 lines), Final Answer line.
Style constraints: no fluff, bound max tokens, discourage redundant restatement.
Run a pilot on 200 training items with N=3 at T=0.8–1.0, top_p≈0.95.
Measure teacher quality on pilot:
% generations with correctly parsed final answer.
% label-correct (matches GSM8K gold).
Average tokens per CoT (keep ≤220).
Iterate prompt until you get ≥70% label-correct and ≤220 tokens median.

Phase 2 — Full data generation with small-N + adaptive sampling (2–4 days)

Sampling plan:
Default N=5 per item.
Adaptive: if ≤1 label-correct in first 3 samples, add up to +3 more (cap total at N=8).
Temp mix: 60% at T=0.8, 40% at T=1.0 to increase diversity without verbosity.
Filters (applied per item after sampling):
Parseability: must have a Final Answer line; discard others.
Label-correct (supervised SCoTD): keep only samples whose answer equals gold.
Length: 40–220 tokens CoT; discard outliers.
Diversity (lightweight): if >3 correct CoTs, keep up to 3 by cosine-diversity (SBERT or tf-idf), else keep all correct.
Keep all metadata: teacher settings, token counts, whether each sample is correct, and per-sample logprobs if available (optional).
Save to JSONL with fields: id, question, reasoning, final_answer, is_correct, meta.

Phase 3 — Student fine-tuning (Gemma 3 4B) (2–3 days active; a few hours compute)

Method: QLoRA (4-bit) for efficiency; sequence length 1k–2k.
Objective: standard LM loss to generate Reasoning + Final Answer given Question and a light “think step-by-step” instruction.
Datasets:
Main SCoTD set (filtered to label-correct).
Label-only baseline set (Question → Final Answer).
Training best practices:
Batch size (effective) 64–128 tokens per device via gradient accumulation; 1–2 epochs max.
LR ~1e-4 (LoRA) with cosine schedule; wd 0; warmup 1–3%.
Early stop on val exact-match; monitor invalid-parse rate.
LoRA ranks 16–32; target attention + MLP; use FlashAttention-3 if available.
Infra on Windows:
Prefer WSL2 or a cloud instance (RunPod/Lambda) with A100/L40S for a few hours.
Track with W&B (loss, EM, length of CoT, parse failures).

Phase 4 — Inference and evaluation (1–2 days)

Variants to evaluate on GSM8K val + test:
Zero-shot direct (no CoT).
Zero-shot CoT prompting.
Label-only fine-tuned.
SCoTD fine-tuned (yours).
Decoding:
Greedy decoding as default.
Light self-consistency: sample k=5 outputs at T=0.7 and take majority on the parsed final answer; report delta vs greedy.
Metrics:
Exact match accuracy.
Invalid-parse rate (should be near zero post-distillation).
Average CoT tokens (lower is better for efficiency).
Report:
Accuracy vs training N (ablation on N∈{1,3,5,8} on a 1k subset if time).
Accuracy vs CoT length bucket.
Teacher–student gap.

Phase 5 — Small, targeted ablations (2–4 days, optional but valuable)

Small-N ablation: N=1 vs N=3 vs N=5 vs adaptive to show SCoTD’s sample-efficiency.
Filtering ablation: only label-correct vs label-correct+length vs label-correct+diversity.
Format ablation: verbose CoT (5–8 lines) vs brief CoT (2–4 lines); measure accuracy and parse errors.
Inference ablation: greedy vs self-consistency (k=3,5).
OOD mini-check (optional): SVAMP or GSM-Hard few-shot CoT prompting vs your SCoTD model.

Phase 6 — Robustness, quality, and analysis (1–2 days)

Error taxonomy: random sample of 50 failures; categorize arithmetic slip, missing step, wrong setup, spurious reasoning.
Human spot-check (lightweight): blind compare 50 CoTs from label-only vs SCoTD; preferability vote on coherence and sufficiency.
Overfitting checks: confirm no contamination of test items in training; lock test set early.

Phase 7 — Documentation and thesis alignment (ongoing)

Keep a lab notebook: prompts tried, teacher settings, costs per batch, acceptance rates after filters.
Record compute and API costs; include in thesis.
Structure result figures analogous to SCoTD: accuracy vs N; self-consistency improvements; ablations.
Implementation details and best practices (no code)

Prompting style (teacher):
Use strict sections: “Question: …”, “Reasoning: …”, “Final Answer: …”.
Hard stop sequences after “Final Answer:” to avoid extra text.
Instruction to be concise: “Use 3–6 short steps. Avoid repeating the question. No extra commentary.”
Visible CoT vs simpler formatting:
Math tasks (GSM8K): full visible CoT as above.
Simple classification (if added): “Scratchpad:” 1–2 short sentences + “Answer: …”.
Data hygiene:
Deduplicate near-identical CoTs per item (cosine >0.98).
Cap per-item kept CoTs to 1–3 even if many are correct; SCoTD benefits more from per-item diversity than volume at training time when N is small.
Training stability:
Freeze non-LoRA weights; clip grad at 1.0; BF16 if available.
Shuffle examples; mix lengths; apply packing if framework supports it.
Reproducibility:
Fix seeds; log versions; export LoRA adapter and full merged model checksum.
Milestones & timeline (suggested)

Week 1: Prototype prompt; 200-item pilot; finalize sampling and filters.
Week 2: Generate full small-N dataset for GSM8K; validate quality; finalize JSONL.
Week 3: Train label-only and SCoTD (1–2 epochs); pick best on val.
Week 4: Full evaluation on test; ablations on N and filters; light self-consistency tests.
Week 5: Optional OOD mini-check; error taxonomy; write-up figures and analysis.
Risk management

Small-N risk: mitigate with label-correct filtering, concise style, and adaptive N for hard items.
Verbosity creep: enforce max CoT length and penalize repetition in prompt.
Budget drift: monitor tokens and stop early if acceptance (label-correct) rate is high enough.
Deliverables checklist

Distillation dataset (JSONL) with metadata and filters logged.
Trained adapters for label-only and SCoTD.
Evaluation scripts/notes producing EM, parse rate, avg CoT length, and ablation plots.
Thesis figures: accuracy vs N; greedy vs self-consistency; filter ablation; sample CoTs.
Optional extensions (only if time permits)

Add a second math set (SVAMP) for transfer check.
Try DoRA or LoRA-r > 32 to test if higher rank helps small-N SCoTD.
Short-form “deliberate-brief” CoTs and compare efficiency vs accuracy.
Questions to finalize before starting

Exact token limits you want for teacher outputs (200 vs 256 vs 300).
Whether to include any non-math tasks (if yes, use short “scratchpad” CoT format).
Compute access (local WSL2 vs short cloud rental) and preferred logging (W&B).
